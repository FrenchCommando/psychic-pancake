Fills US federal taxes for 2018 to 2021

## How to use
Forms are put in the 'forms' folder

To automatically fill taxes
- put personal files (W2.pdf, 1099.xml) in 'input_data' folder
- run 'main.py'
- it opens a windows in which you can override some information
- output is in 'forms.pdf'

## Use cases
Currently most of the configs are set for single resident with no dependent.
The code is modular enough such that changes can be implemented easily.

Can't fill NY forms because they are 'enhanced' 
-> don't know how to manipulate them in python

## Your contribution
Any new form / request is welcome

# Known issues - timesaver for next time

(yes I use it every year for my taxes)

- `merge_pdf` messes up the annotations, so you should print the pdfs one by one
    - easier to keep track as well, if you print everything at once, you'll be overwhelmed
    - you have to attach your ScheduleD to your state return, so you'll print it twice

- about the HSA, you don't need the extra form if you don't contribute out of your paycheck

- when you sent it to `staples` or `fedex` or any other service,
  make sure you flatten your pdfs or the annotations won't print,
    - use `Microsoft print to pdf`
    - you can convert the annotations to read only, but it won't solve the issue

- don't forget to print your `W2`, sometimes you only have it in electronic format

- don't forget to sign

## More advice
- don't push your personal information
- ask for help if you don't know
