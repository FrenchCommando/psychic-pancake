# taxes1040
Fills US federal taxes for 2018 to 2023

## How to use

Deprecated features, not useful

- parse `w2.pdf` and `1099.xlm` inputs
- edit parsed inputs
- merge pdf outputs

### Inputs

- Data should be put in `input_data/20xx/input.json` - just override the values in the existing file, remove the unused items
- Some overriden values in `fill_taxes.py`
(does not matter actually since we don't use the output `pdf` directly)

### Outputs

- in `output/20xx/Federal/fxxxx.pdf`, pdf filled with computed data
- `forms2023.pdf` is obsolete, merging doesn't work well
- `json` files
  - `data20xx.json`: out document values
  - `summary20xx.json`: some relevant values (get some insights into the values rather than some obscure line number)
  - `worksheet20xx.json`: worksheet data

### Script

- edit what you want to run in `fill_taxes.py` (might want to run previous files for carryover), run `main.py`

## What to do with the output

- Federal: [freefile](https://www.freefilefillableforms.com/home/default.php) - now you can do it online, very convenient, and catches potential errors
- NY: use the output to fill the enhenced form (only useful number is the value of the `school tax`)

## Comments

- might find some errors, especially for older dates - please fix those
- caveat for tax computation: did not parse the tax tables (lower than 100k)
- potential project: add some abstraction to compute `sensitivities`, effective tax rate

## Use cases
Currently most of the configs are set for single resident with no dependent.
The code is modular enough such that changes can be implemented easily.

Can't fill NY forms because they are 'enhanced' 
-> enhanced is good, a lot is computed automatically, 
we still show the outputs in the json output

## Your contribution
Any new form / request is welcome

# Known issues - timesaver for next time

(yes I use it every year for my taxes)

- `merge_pdf` messes up the annotations, so you should print the pdfs one by one
    - easier to keep track as well, if you print everything at once, you'll be overwhelmed
    - you have to attach your ScheduleD to your state return, so you'll print it twice

- about the HSA, you don't need the extra form if you don't contribute out of your paycheck

- when you sent it to `staples` or `fedex` or any other service,
  make sure you flatten your pdfs or the annotations won't print,
    - use `Microsoft print to pdf`
    - you can convert the annotations to read only, but it won't solve the issue

- don't forget to print your `W2`, sometimes you only have it in electronic format

- don't forget to sign

## More advice
- don't push your personal information
- ask for help if you don't know
